# diceware-go

A while ago I wrote a program to herald the [EFF's](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/new-wordlists-random-passphrases) new [wordlists](https://www.eff.org/files/2016/07/18/eff_large_wordlist.txt) for creating passwords. I figured this would be an accessible program to write in my newly-learned python language. I was basically correct.

That program turned into a now-banned twitterbot, and a haven't-had-time-to-fix [mastodon bot](https://botsin.space/@dicewarebot).

Goal of the project here is to teach myself golang thorugh building something I find useful.

Attempted output will be something like the below, because I find it fun (and informative) to convert the numbers into unicode dice (to assist people in understanding the concept).
